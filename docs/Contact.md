via email at [team@publicwhip.org.uk](mailto:team@publicwhip.org.uk) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/publicwhip).

Slack is the preferred method though - but please remember that Public Whip is run on a not-for-profit basis and receives no funding whatsoever - we can't always be available to answer requests.
