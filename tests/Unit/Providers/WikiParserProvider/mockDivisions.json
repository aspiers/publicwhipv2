We shall not forget those who were left behind by an Administration who lacked a housing policy and ensured that many of those folk simply never had a chance.\n<p> \n\n The need to spend more on housing is clear. During the previous Parliament, there were successive cuts to housing capital programmes. Local authorities in particular have suffered as allocations under the housing investment programme, for investment in both public and private housing, have been cut from more than &#163;1.7 billion in 1991-92 to less than &#163;900 million this year.\n<p> \n\n Those cuts to local authority resources have had a major effect on council housing stock.

Local authorities have to patch and mend instead of undertaking long-lasting repairs and improvements.\n<p> \n\n That is a waste of scarce resources. Last year, local authorities estimated that the backlog of work needed to bring the stock up to a reasonable state of repair was &#163;20 billion.

As the House will be aware, the Bill came from the Lords with an amendment, made against the Government's wishes, that would have ensured anonymity for those alleged to have committed rape and other offences right up to conviction and throughout the trial process. That was debated in Committee, where the Government argued forcefully that such a blanket prohibition on reporting might interfere with the interests of justice after charge and during the trial process, and that victims might not come forward if, while the police were attempting to identify other potential victims, they did not know that somebody had been charged with an offence.
