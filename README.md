# PublicWhip v2

This HEAVILY UNDER DEVELOPMENT [repository](https://github.com/publicwhip/publicwhipv2) is the home of the
new [PublicWhip](https://www.publicwhip.org.uk) application and website.

It is nowhere near ready for usage at the moment though.

Things that are in place:
* A basic `docker-compose` setup (within the `Docker` folder) enabling you to have a test environment (complete
with test database) setup within a few minutes by running `docker-compose up`.
* Coding standards and base application.

To see what else has been achieved so far, please have a look at the [Milestones](docs/Milestones.md).
